# Agile-User-Story-Predictor

The aim of this project was to use Machine Learning to predict story points, color, app, and owner of user stories by taking the title and description as an input.
The process transforms the documents(title, description fields) via TF-IDF and uses this to make the appropriate classifications via SVC, and Random Forest classification
algorithms.
